# Welcome to our project: Fluffy Study Buddy!

Atmosphere, mood, and environment are factors that can affect concentration and learning ability. Are you used to studying with friends, who normally hold you accountable, but canâ€™t because of quarantine?! We present to you, the loveable companion: Fluffy Study Buddy! This website has a lo-fi Spotify music playlist, a to-do list, a timer, and some pictures of fluffy animals to motivate you! This project was created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (+ libraries such as Bootstrap and jQuery).

## About

This project was created for nwHacks 2022. It was a majority of our team member's first hackathon and we decided to create a study website that had music, to-do-lists, and a timer. We also wanted to challenge ourselves by looking into public APIs. Since we all love animals, we decided to grab randomized pictures of foxes and cats and have them be our "study companions".
